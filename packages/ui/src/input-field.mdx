# InputField

**InputField** is a wrapper component that enables the error state and composition with other components.
This is useful when you want to create an input field with icons or buttons. By default it will render a blank div with default styles.

<Canvas of={InputFieldStories.Default} />

## With `Input` component

By composing the `Input` component with the `InputField` component, you can easily create a form field with error state.

<Canvas of={InputFieldStories.WithInput} />

### With `hasError` state

You can also pass the `hasError` prop to the `InputField` component to set the error state.

<Canvas of={InputFieldStories.WithErrorState} />

## Composition with other components

We can also compose the `InputField` component with other components.

<Canvas of={InputFieldStories.Composition} />
